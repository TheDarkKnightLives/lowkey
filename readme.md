# LowkeyLang

Welcome to **LowkeyLang**, a quirky and easy-to-use programming language inspired by Java and C++. With its unique syntax and playful commands, LowkeyLang is designed for fun and simplicity while allowing for powerful programming constructs.

## Features

- **Variable Declaration**: Declare variables using quirky types.
- **Output Statement**: Print values with a fun command.
- **Control Structures**: Includes unique loop constructs and conditional statements.
- **Function Declaration**: Create and call functions using special keywords.

## Installation

To get started with LowkeyLang, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheDarkKnightLives/lowkey.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd lowkey
```

## Syntax Overview

### Variable Declaration

```lowkey
num x = 10           # A number
words name = "Loki"  # A string
tf isTrue = true     # A boolean
```

### Print Statement

Use `solluuu(value)` to output values to the console.

```lowkey
solluuu("Hello, World!")
```

### Loops

- **While Loop:**
  ```lowkey
  dont stop until (condition) {
      code
  }
  ```

- **Do While Loop:**
  ```lowkey
  do this {
      code
  } when (condition)
  ```

- **For Loop:**
  ```lowkey
  for this(variable_name) is (condition) when it (increment/decrement) {
      code
  }
  ```

### Conditional Statements

- **If Statement:**
  ```lowkey
  this(condition) is true {
      code
  }
  ```

- **If-Else Statement:**
  ```lowkey
  this(condition) is true {
      code
  } else {
      code
  }
  ```

### Function Declaration

Use `marriage` as the keyword to define functions.

```lowkey
marriage greet(words name) {
    solluuu("Hello, " + name)
}
```

### Function Call

Call functions using `calledof name`.

```lowkey
calledof greet("Loki")
```

### Complete Example

Hereâ€™s a simple program demonstrating the syntax:

```lowkey
num age = 25
words name = "Loki"

marriage greet(words name) {
    solluuu("Hello, " + name)
}

if (age >= 18) is true {
    solluuu(name + " is an adult.")
} else {
    solluuu(name + " is not an adult.")
}

for this i is (i < 5) when it (i = i + 1) {
    solluuu("Count: " + i)
}
```
