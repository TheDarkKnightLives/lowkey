# Welcome to LowKeyLang

Are you tired of boring programming languages that don’t give your brain a good laugh? Well, you're in luck! Introducing **LowKeyLang**, where every keyword feels like a meme in the making!

## Why LowKeyLang?

Ever wanted your code to be as fun to read as your favorite memes? With **LowKeyLang**, you can code while laughing! Here’s how we turn the mundane into the hilariously absurd:

### Keyword Translations

- **VAR** becomes **VARNISH**: Because who doesn't want their variables to feel shiny?
- **AND** transforms into **APROM**: It’s like a prom for conditions! Who's bringing the snacks?
- **OR** is now **ALLATHU**: Sounds like a friendly reminder that there are other options, buddy!
- **NOT** is **KEDAYATHU**: Because sometimes you just gotta say "nope!"
- **IF** is replaced with **IDHU**: The "IDHU" clause. Because why not?
- **ELSIF** becomes **IDHUU**: Just to keep things interesting and remind you that there’s more to come!
- **ELSE** is now **ILLANA**: Because “otherwise” sounds too serious.
- **FOR** is transformed to **IDHUKU**: The perfect way to say "let's loop this party!"
- **TO** remains **TO**: Because it’s already too good to change.
- **STEP** becomes **PADI**: One step at a time, or should we say "padi at a time"?

- **FUNC** becomes **KALYANAM**: The most auspicious function you’ll ever define!

- **PRINT** becomes **SOLLUUU**: Because you should always "solluu" what’s on your mind!

## Example Code

Here's how a simple program looks in LowKeyLang:

```lowkey
VARNISH x = 10;
VARNISH name = "Loki";

IDHU x > 5:
    SOLLUU("Loki is greater than 5!");
IDHUU x < 5:
    SOLLUU("Loki is less than 5!");
ILLANA:
    SOLLUU("Loki is exactly 5!");
```
