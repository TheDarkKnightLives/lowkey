the name is 10
the name is "loki"
the name is true 

// done until storing variables in a dictionary

//if the name is repeated in another assign then we can see it get replaced 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

making operation 

i)
the name equals var plus 10 -> this shit works 

ii)
the name equals var plus var -> this shit works  

iii) 
the name equals 10 plus 10 





the operators are 

plus , minus , into , div , remainder 





the name incr -> not done   
the name decr -> not done 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
